# SimilarWords
A program to convert your text to "similar words", a dictionary generated by the RUG.

The similarwords file can be found on [this site](http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/similarwords.gz).
It is automatically generated and contains many weird "similar words", which might be racist or offensive.

The python script reads every line from the std input stream and converts it to a new line, filled with similar words found by the program.
